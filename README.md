# ransomware
This is my first time creating ransomware scripts! I made an encryption script that outputs a encryption/decryption key to a new file along with a decryption script
that uses that same key to decrypt everything! I made both scripts using python3 and the rest of the information you need to know is within the comments
on each file. I dont want anyone downloading them by accident so I put screen caps of the code you can look over for yourself! Enjoy!
